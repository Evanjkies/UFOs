# UFOs

## Overview of Project
The objective of this project was to repurpose data consisting of UFO accounts, to create a website in which this data can be interacted with by the user through a series of  filters.

## Results
On the website there is a table that contains individual UFO accounts over a period of time. In the table there are several columns that contain the characteristics of each UFO sighting. On the left hand of the table ther are five filters that help narrow down the amount of relevant data to the user. The filters are day, city, state, country, and shape. By inputting information into one, a couple or all of the filters you can narrow down the scope of the table once you press the 'Filter Table' at the bottom. The picture below shows what the table looks like one a few filters have been applied. Note how every row has the same date, state and shape describing the sighting. This shows that our filters work. Once you want to establish a new set of filters, just press the "Clear Filters" button located at the bottom.

## Summary

### Drawback
A drawback of this webpage is its lack of data. There are only UFO sightings listed in the table for the first two weeks of 2010. This doesn't give the filters much scope or use.

### Recommendation
One recomendation would be to add another column that contains a clickable link to videos of the sightings if they are provided. Seems likely that UFO enthusiasts that would visit the webpage would be interested in a visual element. Another recommendation would be to add a filter for the duration column. This would take some cleaning up of the data to make the durations more uniform and easily callable by a filter.
